<p>Despite increasingly fierce competition in recent years, Intel remains the go-to CPU maker for laptop manufacturers and consumers alike.<br /><br /></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As of the end of 2021, data from Mercury Research suggested the company accounted for 74.4% of all traditional CPU sales. That was driven by strong sales of its 11th-gen processors, although Rocket Lake desktop CPUs weren’t quite as impressive. However, the current 12th-gen chips have been very well received.<br /><br /></p>

<p>But Intel must continue innovating to fend off the likes of AMD, which hit an all-time high of 25.4% in the same report. The upcoming Zen 4-based Ryzen 7000 Series set to be its best effort yet.<br /><br /></p>

<p>We know that Raptor Lake CPUs are scheduled for release later this year, but the focus of this article is the following generation. Intel has already confirmed its 14th-gen CPUs will be known as Meteor Lake – here’s<br /><br /></p>

<p>Then, as Wccftech reports, Intel has now confirmed that Meteor Lake will begin shipping in 2023. A YouTube video from ‘Moore’s Law is Dead’ suggests it’ll be Q2/Q3 for laptop chips, before the first desktop CPUs arrive in Q4.<br /><br /></p>

<p>Intel’s Innovation event is where we often see new CPUs launch. It takes place on 28-29 September in 2022, and it’s likely to be a similar time next year. We may then see more processors announced at CES 2024, although that’s only speculation at this stage.<br /><br /></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, it’s been forced to deny that all consumer-focused chips will be delayed until 2024. As The Verge reports, there have been plenty of rumours suggesting Meteor Lake is behind schedule. But Intel has insisted that not only will the first Alder Lake CPUs launch in 2023, they’ll be available to purchase before the end of the year.<br /><br /></p>
